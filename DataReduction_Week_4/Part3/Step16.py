Script for calibration and imaging of EVN n14c3 data for J1849+3024/1848+283
NME_all.py or the instructions from the web page should first have been.
run to provide a file with Tsys/gain curve, initial delay and bandpass
calibration applied, 1848+283_J1849+3024.ms (or if this is not available,
use 1848+283_J1849+3024.ms.tgz)
The steps are outline on a web page.

See also NME_3C345_skeleton.py (or, if really stuck, NME_3C345.py) for
the other pair of sources.
