## Program Overview

The **Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy** (DARA) project aims to empower African students and professionals by providing foundational training in astrophysics, radio astronomy, and related technical skills . With Africa emerging as a key region for global astronomy ‚Äî highlighted by major projects like the **Square Kilometre Array** (SKA) and the **South African Large Telescope** (SALT) ‚Äî **DARA** is building local expertise across eight African partner countries: **Ghana**, **Kenya**, **Zambia**, **Namibia**, **Botswana**, **Madagascar**, **Mozambique**, and **Mauritius** .

**üéì Training Programme Highlights**

Fully funded by the University of Leeds: no fees, travel, or accommodation costs for participants.

**Includes hands-on training in:**

-Technical computing : Linux, Python, data analysis & reduction.

-Optical astronomy at Turkana Basin Institute (Kenya).

-Radio astronomy at Hartebeesthoek Observatory (South Africa).

Concludes with the DARA Annual Network Meeting , connecting trainees with researchers and space industry professionals.

**üìú Outcomes**

Upon completion, participants receive a certificate and are eligible to apply for advanced academic programs (MSc, PhD), or contribute to the growth of high-tech industries in Africa.

**WEEK 1: Computer skills**

In just one intensive week, the DARA (Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy) community successfully completed a foundational training in computational skills, equipping participants with essential tools for data-driven astronomy research. This immersive program blended theory with hands-on practice, culminating in daily quizzes to reinforce learning and Final Project to complete to get certificate for the week 1.

  **Day 1** :	Python Basics	(Syntax, data structures, functions)
  
  **Day 2**	: ETL with Pandas	(Data cleaning, transformation, and loading)
  
  **Day 3**	: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)	(Visualization with Matplotlib, statistical analysis with NumPy)
  
  **Day 4**	: Astronomy Tools	 (Jupyter Lab, Astropy for astronomical data processing)
  
  **Day 5**	: Linux Command Line (Bash scripting, file system navigation)

**Why This Matters**
This training is part of DARA‚Äôs mission to:

üåç Empower African researchers with cutting-edge data science skills.

üî≠ Bridge the gap between astronomy and big data technologies.

üèÜ Foster collaboration through open-source tools and reproducible research.
