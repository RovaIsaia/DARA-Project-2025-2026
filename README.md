## Program Overview
WEEK 1:
In just one intensive week, the DARA (Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy) community successfully completed a foundational training in computational skills, equipping participants with essential tools for data-driven astronomy research. This immersive program blended theory with hands-on practice, culminating in daily quizzes to reinforce learning.

  **Day 1** :	Python Basics	(Syntax, data structures, functions)
  **Day 2**	: ETL with Pandas	(Data cleaning, transformation, and loading)
  **Day 3**	: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)	(Visualization with Matplotlib, statistical analysis with NumPy)
  **Day 4**	: Astronomy Tools	 (Jupyter Lab, Astropy for astronomical data processing)
  **Day 5**	: Linux Command Line (Bash scripting, file system navigation)

## Why This Matters
This training is part of DARA’s mission to:

🌍 Empower African researchers with cutting-edge data science skills.

🔭 Bridge the gap between astronomy and big data technologies.

🏆 Foster collaboration through open-source tools and reproducible research.
