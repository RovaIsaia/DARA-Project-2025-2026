## Program Overview
WEEK 1:
In just one intensive week, the DARA (Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy) community successfully completed a foundational training in computational skills, equipping participants with essential tools for data-driven astronomy research. This immersive program blended theory with hands-on practice, culminating in daily quizzes to reinforce learning.

**Day**        **Focus Area**	                            **Key Skills Acquired**
  1  	           Python Basics	                            Syntax, data structures, functions
  2	             ETL with Pandas	                          Data cleaning, transformation, and loading
  3  	           Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)	          Visualization with Matplotlib, statistical analysis with NumPy
  4	             Astronomy Tools	                          Jupyter Lab, Astropy for astronomical data processing
  5	             Linux Command Line	                        Bash scripting, file system navigation

## Why This Matters
This training is part of DARA‚Äôs mission to:

üåç Empower African researchers with cutting-edge data science skills.

üî≠ Bridge the gap between astronomy and big data technologies.

üèÜ Foster collaboration through open-source tools and reproducible research.
